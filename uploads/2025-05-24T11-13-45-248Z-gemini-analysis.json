The listed skills include HTML and CSS, which are crucial for a front-end developer. However, the skills section lacks mention of JavaScript or any front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js), which are highly desirable for a front-end intern role. The education is a B.Tech, which is generally aligned, but the lack of a specified graduation year makes it difficult to assess the candidate's current academic standing. Overall potential is moderate, contingent on the candidate's willingness to learn and adapt to new technologies."
