The candidate lists HTML/CSS, which are core skills, but lacks other essential frontend skills like JavaScript and React/Angular/Vue.js. This results in a low skills match score. The internship experience is brief and lacks specific details on frontend technologies used, leading to a low experience relevance score. The overall potential is moderate, considering the candidate's interest in web development and AI, but requires significant upskilling in core frontend technologies. For example, the candidate mentions 'Netflix Clone Platform' but doesn't specify the frontend technologies used. The experience duration is very short (1 month), impacting the experience score."
