While Java, SQL, and Machine Learning are valuable, they are less directly relevant to a front-end focused role. The internships, though short, provide some practical experience in web development, particularly with the Netflix clone and portfolio website. The B.Tech degree is relevant, and the high CGPA indicates strong academic performance. The web development certification from Internshala is a positive indicator. The projects, while interesting, seem more focused on Machine Learning and Deep Learning, which are less directly applicable to a junior web developer role. Her potential is good, given her academic record and internship experience, but she needs to focus on deepening her front-end skills and gaining more practical experience in that area. The ethical hacking certifications are not directly relevant but demonstrate a proactive approach to learning."

Her internships at DevElet provide some relevant experience in front-end development, specifically mentioning a Netflix clone and portfolio website. The listed skills include HTML and CSS, which are core front-end technologies. However, the resume lacks mention of JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Vue), which are commonly required for front-end roles. The CodeKaro HTML/CSS certification is a plus. The projects, while interesting, don't directly showcase advanced front-end skills. The overall potential is moderate, as the candidate demonstrates initiative and a willingness to learn, but needs to develop a stronger front-end skillset, especially with modern frameworks."

The 'Cybersecurity Fundamentals' skill and the Ethical Hacking certifications are directly relevant. While her internship experience is primarily in web development, the projects like 'DEEPVISION: DEEPFAKE DETECTION' showcase an interest and potential in security-related areas. The SQL/Database Management skill is also valuable. \n\n**Skills Match (22/30):** The presence of 'Cybersecurity Fundamentals' and Ethical Hacking certifications are positive. However, the lack of specific cybersecurity tools or experience beyond fundamentals limits the score. The SQL skill is a bonus. More hands-on experience with security tools and frameworks would significantly improve this score.\n\n**Experience Relevance (15/30):** The internship experience is primarily focused on front-end and full-stack development, which has limited direct relevance to cybersecurity. However, the 'DEEPFAKE DETECTION' project indicates an interest in security and demonstrates an ability to apply technical skills to security-related problems. The experience developing applications also provides a foundation for understanding potential vulnerabilities. \n\n**Education Alignment (15/20):** A B.Tech degree is generally suitable for a cybersecurity role. The high CGPA is a positive indicator of academic performance. While not a dedicated cybersecurity degree, the technical foundation is strong. \n\n**Overall Potential (20/20):** Alamanda demonstrates strong potential. Her academic record, combined with her certifications and project work, suggests a willingness to learn and a capacity for growth. With targeted training and mentoring, she could quickly develop the necessary skills to become a valuable member of a cybersecurity team. Her enthusiasm and diverse skillset (including web development) could be beneficial in understanding a broader range of security challenges."
