The Skills Match score is 20% because out of the core front-end skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), only HTML and CSS were listed. Experience Relevance is low (5%) due to the short duration of the internships (2 months total) and the limited detail on project complexity. The expected experience for a junior role is assumed to be at least 12 months. Education Alignment is high (100%) as a B.Tech degree is generally acceptable. Overall Potential is moderate, considering the internships and basic front-end skills, but the lack of JavaScript experience is a significant drawback. For example, the candidate mentions developing a Netflix clone, but the resume lacks details on the technologies used beyond HTML and CSS."
