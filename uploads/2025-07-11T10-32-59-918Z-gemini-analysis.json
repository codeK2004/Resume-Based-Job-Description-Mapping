Assuming the ideal candidate has 6 months of experience, the experience score is (2/6)*30 = 10 points. The projects mentioned (Weather Forecast Application, Netflix Clone, Personal Portfolio Website, Task Manager Application) are relevant. Education Alignment: The candidate has a B.Tech degree. Assuming a B.Tech is a good fit, the education score is (70/100)*20 = 14 points. Overall Potential: The candidate has intern experience, showing initiative. The candidate also has full stack experience, which is a plus. Potential score is (50/100)*20 = 10 points. Overall Score: 10 + 10 + 14 + 10 = 44."

While developing a Weather Forecast Application, Netflix Clone, Personal Portfolio Website, and Task Manager Application are relevant, the brief internship duration impacts the score. The Education Alignment score is 15% because the candidate has a B.Tech degree, which is somewhat relevant, but the field of study is not specified, and the recency is not clear. The Overall Potential score is 23% because the candidate has internship experience and some relevant skills, suggesting a capacity to learn and adapt, but the lack of depth in web development-specific skills limits the potential score. For example, the candidate mentions Java and Machine Learning Algorithms, which are not core to front-end web development."
