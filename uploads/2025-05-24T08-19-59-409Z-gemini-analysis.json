        "detailedAnalysis": "Alamanda's resume shows a decent foundation for a Front-End Developer role, but lacks depth. \n\n**Skills Match (20/30):**  The resume lists HTML and CSS, which are core front-end skills. However, there's no mention of JavaScript or any modern front-end frameworks/libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js. The absence of these crucial technologies significantly impacts the skills match score. The presence of Java, SQL, and Machine Learning skills are less relevant for a front-end role, though they demonstrate a broader technical aptitude. The CodeKaro HTML/CSS certification is a positive, but a single certification isn't enough to demonstrate mastery.\n\n**Experience Relevance (18/30):**  The intern positions at DevElet are relevant. Developing a Netflix clone and a personal portfolio website are good starting points. However, the short duration of each internship (one month each) raises questions about the depth of experience gained. The responsibilities listed are somewhat generic. More specific details about the technologies used and the challenges overcome would strengthen this section.\n\n**Education Alignment (15/20):** A B.Tech degree is generally acceptable for a front-end role. The CGPA of 9.33 is excellent and indicates strong academic performance. However, the resume doesn't specify the major within the B.Tech degree. If it's Computer Science or a related field, the alignment is stronger. If it's a less relevant field, the alignment is weaker. The intermediate and secondary education are not directly relevant to the role.\n\n**Overall Potential (15/20):** Alamanda demonstrates potential through her projects (Deepfake detection and voice-assisted calculator), which showcase problem-solving skills and technical curiosity. The Internshala Web Development certification also indicates a desire to learn. However, the lack of JavaScript and framework experience is a significant hurdle. With targeted learning and further practical experience, Alamanda could develop into a competent front-end developer. The soft skills (English, Hindi, Telugu) are a bonus for communication and collaboration."

        "detailedAnalysis": "Alamanda's profile shows a good foundation for a Full-Stack Developer role, but lacks substantial professional experience.  \n\n**Skills Match (20/30):**  She has a mix of relevant technical skills (HTML, CSS, Java, SQL) which are crucial for a full-stack role. The listed skills are somewhat broad (e.g., \"Machine Learning Algorithms\") and require further clarification on the depth of knowledge. The absence of Javascript, a core skill for front-end development, is a significant drawback. The soft skills listed are helpful but not directly related to coding ability. The certifications in HTML and CSS are positive, but recent and potentially basic. \n\n**Experience Relevance (18/30):**  Her internships at DevElet, particularly the \"Full Stack Intern\" role, are relevant. However, the duration is very short (1 month each). The projects listed (Personal Portfolio Website, Task Manager Application) are good starting points but likely represent beginner-level experience. More detail on the technologies used and the complexity of these projects would be beneficial. The Weather Forecast Application and Netflix Clone are good projects for showcasing front-end skills.\n\n**Education Alignment (15/20):**  A B.Tech degree is generally aligned with the requirements of a Full-Stack Developer role. A CGPA of 9.33 is excellent and indicates strong academic performance. However, the specific field of B.Tech is not mentioned, which could impact the relevance. Further information on the coursework would be helpful.\n\n**Overall Potential (15/20):**  Alamanda demonstrates potential through her education, internships, and projects. The ethical hacking certifications suggest an interest in security, which is a valuable asset. The Cambridge English certification is a plus for communication. However, the short duration of her internships and the lack of Javascript proficiency limit her immediate readiness for a full-stack role. She would likely benefit from further training and mentorship to fully realize her potential."

The soft skills are helpful for communication and collaboration.\n\n**Experience Relevance (15/30):** The internship experiences, while showcasing development skills, lack direct cybersecurity relevance. Developing web applications and portfolio websites doesn't translate directly to security analysis.  The absence of security-focused projects or internships is a weakness. The projects listed are more related to software development and machine learning.\n\n**Education Alignment (17/20):** A B.Tech degree is generally acceptable for a junior cybersecurity analyst position, especially if the curriculum included relevant coursework (though the resume doesn't specify). The strong CGPA indicates a good academic record. Further details on the B.Tech specialization would be beneficial.\n\n**Overall Potential (20/20):** Alamanda demonstrates a strong aptitude for learning and a proactive approach to skill development, evidenced by the numerous certifications and projects.
