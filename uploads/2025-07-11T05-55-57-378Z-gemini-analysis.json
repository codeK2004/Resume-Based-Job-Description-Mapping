The Education Alignment score is 100% because the candidate has a B.Tech degree, which is generally acceptable for this role. The Overall Potential score is low because the candidate's experience is limited and the skills listed are not strongly aligned with front-end development."

(2/5) * 30 = 12. Experience Relevance: The candidate has two months of front-end intern experience and one month of full-stack intern experience where they developed a portfolio website and a Netflix clone. Assuming the expected experience is 5 months, (2/5) * 30 = 12. Education Alignment: The candidate has a B.Tech degree. Assuming a B.Tech is a good fit, the education alignment score is 90%.
