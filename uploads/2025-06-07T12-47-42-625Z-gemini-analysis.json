The skill match is moderate (40%) due to the presence of HTML/CSS, but a lack of JavaScript and modern front-end frameworks like React or Angular. The experience relevance is limited (30%) due to the short internship duration and the focus on full-stack development, which only partially aligns with the Junior Front-End Developer role. The education alignment is strong (80%) given the B.Tech degree, although the specific field of study isn't specified. Overall potential is moderate (50%) as the candidate shows initiative with personal projects, but needs to develop more specialized front-end skills. For example, the portfolio website and Netflix clone demonstrate practical application of HTML/CSS, but the absence of JavaScript proficiency is a significant gap."

Example: HTML/CSS is a direct match.\n\nExperience Relevance: The candidate has experience as a Front End Intern and Full Stack Intern. The description mentions relevant projects like a Netflix Clone and Personal Portfolio Website. Given the limited duration specified (1 month of Full Stack experience), the experience relevance is estimated at 30%. Example: Netflix Clone project indicates front-end development experience.\n\nEducation Alignment: The candidate has a B.TECH degree, which aligns with the educational requirements. The field of study is assumed to be relevant (e.g., Computer Science or related field), resulting in an 80% education match. \n\nOverall Potential: The candidate's internship experience and project descriptions suggest a willingness to learn and adapt. The listed skills, while not all directly relevant, indicate a broad interest in technology, contributing to a 50% potential score."
