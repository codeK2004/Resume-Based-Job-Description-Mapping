The skills section lists HTML and CSS, which are essential for front-end development. However, the skills list also includes unrelated skills like Java, Cybersecurity Fundamentals, SQL, and Machine Learning Algorithms, suggesting a broader, less focused skillset. The education alignment is moderate, as a B.Tech degree can be relevant depending on the specialization and coursework. Overall potential is moderate, considering the limited internship duration and the need for further development in core front-end technologies like JavaScript and frameworks."
