The Full Stack internship is less relevant. The B.Tech degree is generally aligned, contributing to a reasonable education score. The overall potential is moderate, considering the candidate's interest in web development and AI, but further front-end specific skills development is needed. For example, the candidate mentions Python, Java, and Machine Learning, which are not core to front-end development. The experience score is low due to the lack of duration information."

        "detailedAnalysis": "The candidate demonstrates a moderate fit for the Front-End Developer Intern position. \n\nSkills Match: The candidate lists HTML/CSS, which are core front-end skills. However, the resume lacks mention of JavaScript and front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js. Assuming 5 required skills (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, responsive design, version control), the candidate matches 2, resulting in (2/5) * 30 = 12 points. Adjusted to 40% to account for the importance of HTML/CSS.\n\nExperience Relevance: The candidate has experience as a Front End Intern at DevElet, working on projects like a Weather Forecast Application, Netflix Clone Platform, Personal Portfolio Website, and Task Manager Application. The duration is not specified for the Front End Intern role, but the Full Stack Intern role is 1 month. Assuming the Front End Intern role was also 1 month, and expecting 3 months of experience for an intern, the score is (1/3) * 30 = 10 points. Adjusted to 30% to account for the lack of specific details.\n\nEducation Alignment: The candidate has a B.TECH degree from Malla Reddy College of Engineering and Technology. While the field of study isn't specified, a B.TECH degree is generally relevant to software development. Assuming a strong alignment, the education match score is 90, resulting in (90/100) * 20 = 18 points.\n\nOverall Potential: The candidate's resume mentions an interest in web development, AI, and Cybersecurity. The projects listed demonstrate a willingness to learn and apply new technologies. However, the lack of specific front-end skills and experience limits the overall potential score. Assuming a moderate learning curve and adaptability, the potential score is 50, resulting in (50/100) * 20 = 10 points.\n\nOverall Score: 12 + 10 + 18 + 10 = 50. Adjusted to 55 to account for the projects."

The candidate's experience as a Full Stack Intern is relevant, but the duration is short (1 month). The B.TECH degree is generally aligned with the educational requirements, but the field of study is not specified, impacting the education alignment score. The candidate's potential is moderate, considering the stated interest in AI and web development, but further development in core data science areas is needed.

The candidate shows potential due to their interest in AI and web development, which can be complementary to cybersecurity, but requires further development in core cybersecurity skills. For example, while the candidate lists 'Cybersecurity Fundamentals,' there's no mention of specific security tools, frameworks, or incident response experience. The experience score is low due to the short duration of the internship (1 month) and its primary focus on full-stack development rather than direct cybersecurity tasks. The education match is moderate as a B.Tech is relevant, but a specialization in Computer Science or Cybersecurity would have resulted in a higher score."
