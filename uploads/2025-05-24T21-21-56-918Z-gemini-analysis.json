While their listed skills are more heavily weighted towards frontend, the 'Full Stack' experience suggests a broader understanding. This role would allow them to utilize their existing skills while learning more about backend development.",

Experience as a Front End and Full Stack intern provides limited direct experience in technical support. A B.Tech degree is generally aligned with the educational requirements. The candidate's potential is moderate, given their interest in web development, AI, and Cybersecurity, which could be leveraged for problem-solving and learning new technologies relevant to the support role. However, direct experience in troubleshooting, customer service, and specific hardware/software support is lacking."

Skills like Python, Java, and AI are not core to data entry. The internships are focused on web development, not data management or entry. The B.Tech degree provides a general foundation, but specific data entry training is absent. Potential exists due to general technical aptitude, but significant training would be required."
