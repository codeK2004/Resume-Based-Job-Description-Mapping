This role typically involves both front-end and back-end tasks, and her experience with creating a portfolio website and task manager application is relevant.

Internship experience at DevElet as both a Front End and Full Stack Intern provides some relevant practical experience, particularly the development of a Netflix clone and a personal portfolio website. The skills listed include HTML and CSS, which are essential for a Junior Web Developer, but lack mention of JavaScript and modern frameworks like React or Angular, which are highly desirable. The inclusion of Java, Cybersecurity Fundamentals, SQL, and Machine Learning Algorithms, while valuable, are less directly relevant to a front-end focused role. Overall potential is moderate, contingent on rapid skill acquisition in JavaScript and relevant frameworks."
