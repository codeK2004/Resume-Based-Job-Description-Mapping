However, the candidate's skills list also includes Java, Cybersecurity Fundamentals, SQL/Database Management, and Machine Learning Algorithms, which are less directly relevant to front-end development. The overall potential is moderate, considering the limited duration of the internships and the need for further development in core front-end technologies like JavaScript and frameworks."
