The skills match is low, with only HTML/CSS directly aligning with frontend development (1/3 core skills). Experience is limited to internships, with only one month explicitly as a Full Stack Intern, and the descriptions mention frontend projects, but lack specifics on technologies used. The B.TECH degree is somewhat relevant, but the field of study is not specified, resulting in a moderate education alignment. Overall potential is moderate, considering the candidate's interest in web development and AI, but requires further assessment of their frontend-specific learning curve. For example, the candidate mentions Python, Java, Cybersecurity Fundamentals, Generative AI, SQL/Database Management, and Machine Learning Algorithms, which are not core frontend skills."

The skills match is decent, with HTML/CSS being a direct hit, but lacks other core frontend skills like JavaScript and React. Experience is relevant, with projects like the Netflix Clone and Personal Portfolio showcasing frontend capabilities, but the duration is short. Education aligns well with a B.Tech degree, although the field of study isn't specified. Overall potential is good, given the full-stack aspirations and exposure to AI, suggesting adaptability and a willingness to learn. For example, the Weather Forecast Application and Task Manager Application are good projects, but more detail on the technologies used would be beneficial. The candidate's experience as a Full Stack Intern is a plus, but the duration is very short (1 month)."
