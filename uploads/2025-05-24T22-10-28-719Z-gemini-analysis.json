Her experience developing a Netflix clone and weather forecast application demonstrates practical application of front-end technologies. The portfolio website development also showcases her ability to build user interfaces. The match score is not higher due to the limited duration of her internship and the lack of specific framework experience (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) listed in her resume.",

The development of a Task Manager application and a personal portfolio website indicates some understanding of both front-end and back-end concepts.
