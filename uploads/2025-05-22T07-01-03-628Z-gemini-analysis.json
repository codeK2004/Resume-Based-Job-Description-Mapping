        "detailedAnalysis": "Alamanda's resume shows a B.Tech degree with a strong CGPA, indicating a good academic foundation. Her technical skills include HTML and CSS, which are essential for a Front-End Developer, but the resume lacks mention of JavaScript, React, Angular, or Vue.js, which are commonly required. The 'CodeKaro - HTML, CSS' certification is a positive sign. Her internships at DevElet provide some relevant experience, particularly the Netflix Clone and Personal Portfolio Website projects. However, the internship durations are short (1-2 months each). While the resume highlights several projects, their direct relevance to front-end development is somewhat limited. The 'DEEPVISION' and 'SPEAKSOLVE' projects, while impressive, are not directly related to front-end development. The lack of specific front-end frameworks or libraries experience (e.g., React, Angular, Vue) significantly impacts the Skills Match score. Her overall potential is moderate, given her strong academic record and internship experience, but needs further development in core front-end technologies."

        "detailedAnalysis": "Alamanda's resume indicates a foundational understanding of web development.  The 'HTML' and 'CSS' skills are a good starting point. The 'CodeKaro - HTML, CSS' certification and the 'Web Development' Internshala certification further support this. The 'FRONT END INTERN' and 'FULL STACK INTERN' experiences, while brief (August-October 2024), are directly relevant, particularly the development of a 'Netflix Clone' and 'Personal Portfolio Website'. The B.TECH degree is relevant, though the specific major isn't specified, so the alignment is moderate. The projects, while interesting, are not directly related to core web development. The potential is moderate, based on the internships and certifications, but more practical experience and a deeper understanding of JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue) would significantly improve her candidacy. The limited duration of the internships is a concern. The resume also lists 'Java', 'Cybersecurity Fundamentals', 'SQL/Database Management', and 'Machine Learning Algorithms', which are less relevant to a front-end web developer role, and might dilute the focus of the application. Further investigation into her proficiency with JavaScript and related frameworks is recommended."

        "detailedAnalysis": "Alamanda's profile shows a good foundation for a Junior Cybersecurity Analyst role, but requires further development in core cybersecurity skills. \n\n**Skills Match (20/30):**  The resume lists \"Cybersecurity Fundamentals,\" which is positive. However, the depth of understanding is unclear.  SQL/Database Management is a valuable adjacent skill. The other listed skills (Java, Machine Learning, HTML, CSS) are less directly relevant, although Machine Learning could be useful in certain cybersecurity contexts.  The soft skills are helpful for communication and collaboration. The Ethical Hacking certifications are a strong positive, but their duration and depth need to be validated.  A higher score would require more specific cybersecurity skills (e.g., network security, penetration testing, incident response, SIEM tools). \n\n**Experience Relevance (15/30):** The internship experience is primarily focused on web development and full-stack development.  While these experiences demonstrate coding abilities and project management, they are not directly related to cybersecurity.  The Deepfake detection project is relevant and suggests an interest in security, but the resume doesn't specify Alamanda's role or contribution to the project.  More cybersecurity-related projects or internships would significantly improve this score.\n\n**Education Alignment (18/20):** A B.Tech degree is a solid foundation. The high CGPA is a positive indicator of academic ability. While the degree isn't specified, it is likely in Computer Science or a related field, which is beneficial. A degree specifically in Cybersecurity or Information Security would have resulted in a higher score. \n\n**Overall Potential (15/20):** Alamanda demonstrates a willingness to learn and engage with technology through internships and projects. The certifications, even if short, show initiative. The combination of technical skills (even if not all directly cybersecurity-related) and a strong academic record suggests good potential for growth within a cybersecurity role. However, the lack of deep cybersecurity experience limits the score.  Further training and hands-on experience would significantly enhance their potential."
