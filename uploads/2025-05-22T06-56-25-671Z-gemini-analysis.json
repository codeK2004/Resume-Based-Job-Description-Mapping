        "detailedAnalysis": "Alamanda's resume indicates a decent fit for a Front-End Developer position, but with some areas for improvement. \n\n**Skills Match (20/30):** The resume lists HTML and CSS, which are core front-end skills. However, the absence of JavaScript (or any specific JavaScript framework/library like React, Angular, or Vue) is a significant drawback. The candidate also lists Java, SQL, and Machine Learning, which are less directly relevant to a front-end role. The CodeKaro HTML/CSS certification is a positive indicator, but more depth is needed. The soft skills are relevant for communication and collaboration.\n\n**Experience Relevance (15/30):** The internship experience at DevElet is relevant, particularly the Netflix Clone and Personal Portfolio Website projects. These suggest some practical experience with front-end development. However, the short duration of the internships (August-October 2024) and the simultaneous involvement in full-stack development raise questions about the depth of front-end experience. More details about the specific technologies used and the candidate's role in each project would be beneficial.\n\n**Education Alignment (18/20):** A B.Tech degree is generally a good foundation for a software development role. The high CGPA (9.33) indicates strong academic performance. While the specific field of B.Tech is not mentioned, it is assumed to be related to computer science or a similar field. \n\n**Overall Potential (15/20):** The candidate's projects (DeepFake detection and voice-assisted calculator) demonstrate initiative and problem-solving skills. The various certifications, including Ethical Hacking and Web Development, show a willingness to learn and expand their skillset. However, the lack of specific front-end frameworks/libraries experience limits the potential score. With further training and experience in front-end technologies, Alamanda has the potential to become a strong front-end developer."

Her projects, particularly 'DEEPVISION: DEEPFAKE DETECTION USING DEEPLEARNING,' showcase an interest in security-related applications of technology. While her internship experience is primarily focused on front-end and full-stack development, the technical skills gained (Java, SQL, HTML, CSS) are transferable and useful in a cybersecurity context, especially for web application security. Her soft skills, including strong English proficiency, are also beneficial for communication and collaboration. Her potential is high due to her academic achievements, certifications, and demonstrated interest in security. However, the lack of dedicated cybersecurity-related work experience limits her score in that area. Further development of specific cybersecurity skills (e.g., network security, incident response, penetration testing) would significantly enhance her candidacy."
