This demonstrates a foundational understanding of front-end development principles. Their skills in HTML/CSS are directly applicable.

The Skills Match is moderate (40%) due to the presence of HTML/CSS, but a lack of JavaScript and modern front-end frameworks like React or Angular. The Experience Relevance is low (30%) because the internship duration is short (1 month) and the descriptions are vague. The Education Alignment is strong (80%) as a B.Tech degree is relevant, though the specific field of study isn't provided. The Overall Potential is moderate (50%) considering the candidate's internship experience and stated interest in web development, but a lack of specific front-end skills limits the score. For example, the candidate mentions building a Netflix clone, but the technologies used are not specified. A higher score would require demonstrable proficiency in JavaScript and a modern framework."

The projects listed in the resume (Weather Forecast Application, Netflix Clone, Personal Portfolio Website, Task Manager Application) align well with the typical responsibilities of a front-end intern.

Other skills like Python, Java, SQL, Cybersecurity, Generative AI and Machine Learning are less relevant for a front-end role, resulting in a 40% skill match. Example: HTML/CSS is a direct match.\n\nExperience Relevance: The candidate has experience as a Front End Intern and Full Stack Intern. The description mentions relevant projects like a Netflix clone and a personal portfolio website. However, the duration of the Full Stack internship is only one month, and the Front End internship has no duration specified, leading to a 30% experience match. Example: Netflix clone project is relevant.\n\nEducation Alignment: The candidate has a B.TECH degree, which aligns with the educational requirements. The field of study is not specified, but a B.TECH degree is generally considered relevant, resulting in an 80% education match. Example: B.TECH degree is a good fit.\n\nOverall Potential: The candidate's stated aspiration and project portfolio suggest a willingness to learn and adapt. However, the limited experience and the breadth of listed skills (some not directly relevant) indicate a need for focused development in front-end technologies, resulting in a 50% potential score. Example: Portfolio website indicates initiative."

Overall Potential is estimated at 50%, considering the candidate's stated interest in web development and the projects undertaken during the internship, but the lack of depth in web-specific skills and experience limits the score.
