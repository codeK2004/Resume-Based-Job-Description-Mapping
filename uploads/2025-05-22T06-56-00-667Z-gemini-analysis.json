        "detailedAnalysis": "Alamanda's resume presents a mixed profile for a Frontend Developer position.  \n\n**Skills Match (20/30):** While the resume lists HTML and CSS, which are core frontend skills, the emphasis is more on general technical skills like Java, SQL, and Machine Learning. The CodeKaro HTML/CSS certification is a positive, but the lack of mention of JavaScript and modern frontend frameworks/libraries (React, Angular, Vue) significantly lowers the score.  The resume does not demonstrate a strong focus on frontend technologies.\n\n**Experience Relevance (15/30):** The internship experience at DevElet includes developing a Netflix clone and a personal portfolio website, which are relevant to frontend development. However, the internship durations are very short (1-2 months each). The Task Manager application could involve frontend work, but the description lacks specifics. The Weather Forecast application is a good sign. Overall, the experience is limited and lacks depth.\n\n**Education Alignment (15/20):** A B.Tech degree is generally suitable for a software development role. The high CGPA (9.33) is a positive indicator of academic performance. However, the resume doesn't specify the B.Tech specialization, which is important. If the specialization is Computer Science or a related field, the score would be higher. Without that information, a moderate score is assigned.\n\n**Overall Potential (15/20):** Alamanda demonstrates potential through their projects and certifications. The DeepFake detection project showcases an interest in advanced technologies, and the voice-assisted calculator highlights problem-solving skills. The ethical hacking certifications and employability skills training suggest a proactive approach to learning and career development. However, the lack of a strong frontend focus in their skills and experience limits the overall potential score for this specific role. Further investigation during an interview would be needed to assess their aptitude and willingness to learn frontend technologies quickly."

Her technical skills list includes HTML and CSS, which are essential for a Web Developer, earning a decent score in skills match. However, the absence of JavaScript and modern front-end frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) significantly lowers the score. The internship experience is relevant, particularly the 'Netflix Clone' and 'Personal Portfolio Website' projects, but the short duration (August-October 2024) limits the depth of experience. The B.Tech degree is relevant, and the strong CGPA is a positive indicator, contributing to a good education alignment score. The projects demonstrate initiative and problem-solving abilities, and the certifications in web development and ethical hacking suggest a willingness to learn and a broad interest in technology, leading to a moderate overall potential score. To improve her candidacy, Alamanda should focus on acquiring proficiency in JavaScript and a modern front-end framework, and seek longer-term, more in-depth web development experiences."

While her internship experience is primarily in front-end and full-stack development, the mention of Cybersecurity Fundamentals and Machine Learning Algorithms in her skills section, along with the Deepfake detection project, suggests an interest and some foundational knowledge in cybersecurity. The SQL/Database Management skill is also valuable. However, the lack of direct cybersecurity experience limits the experience relevance score. Her soft skills, including strong English proficiency, are beneficial for communication and collaboration. Her overall potential is high, given her academic performance, certifications, and project work, suggesting a capacity to learn and grow within a cybersecurity role. Further development in specific cybersecurity tools and technologies would significantly enhance her candidacy."
