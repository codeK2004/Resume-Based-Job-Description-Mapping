The Skills Match is moderate (40%) due to the presence of HTML/CSS, but a lack of JavaScript and modern front-end frameworks like React or Angular. The Experience Relevance is low (30%) because the internship durations are short and lack specific details on front-end contributions. The Education Alignment is strong (80%) given the B.Tech degree, assuming it's in a related field like Computer Science. Overall Potential is moderate (50%) as the candidate shows interest in web development but needs to develop core front-end skills. For example, the portfolio website project is a good start, but further projects demonstrating proficiency in JavaScript and a modern framework are needed."

However, the resume lacks mention of JavaScript, a crucial skill. Experience Relevance: The candidate's experience as a Front End Intern at DevElet is relevant, particularly the projects mentioned (Weather Forecast Application, Netflix Clone, Personal Portfolio, Task Manager). However, the duration is not specified for the Front End Intern role, and the Full Stack Intern role is only one month. Education Alignment: The candidate has a B.TECH degree, which aligns well with the educational requirements. Overall Potential: The candidate's projects indicate a willingness to learn and apply front-end technologies. The mention of Full Stack experience and interest in AI/Cybersecurity suggests a broader technical aptitude. However, the lack of specific JavaScript skills is a concern."
