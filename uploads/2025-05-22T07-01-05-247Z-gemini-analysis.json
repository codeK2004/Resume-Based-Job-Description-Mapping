        "detailedAnalysis": "Alamanda's resume shows a good foundation for a Front-End Developer role, but lacks depth and breadth. \n\n**Skills Match (18/30):**  The resume lists HTML and CSS, which are essential. However, there's no mention of JavaScript or any modern front-end frameworks/libraries (React, Angular, Vue). The inclusion of Java, Cybersecurity, SQL, and Machine Learning, while valuable in general, are not directly relevant to front-end development. The CodeKaro HTML/CSS certification is a positive, but more advanced skills are needed. Score reflects basic skills present but significant gaps in core front-end technologies.\n\n**Experience Relevance (15/30):** The internships at DevElet are relevant. Developing a Netflix clone and a personal portfolio website fall under front-end development. However, the duration of each internship is short (1-2 months). The responsibilities listed are vague and lack details on specific technologies used or challenges overcome. The Task Manager application could have front-end components, but the description doesn't clarify. The Weather Forecast Application is a good project. More details about the specific front-end technologies used in these projects would be beneficial. Score reflects some relevant experience, but limited duration and lack of detailed descriptions impact the overall assessment.\n\n**Education Alignment (15/20):** A B.Tech degree is generally acceptable. The high CGPA is a positive indicator of academic ability. However, the resume doesn't specify the major within B.Tech. If the major is Computer Science or a related field, the score would be higher. The other educational experiences are less relevant. Score reflects a generally acceptable education, but lacks specific alignment to front-end development.\n\n**Overall Potential (17/20):** Alamanda demonstrates a willingness to learn and explore different technologies through internships and certifications. The project descriptions show initiative. The inclusion of soft skills like English, Hindi, and Telugu is a plus for communication and collaboration. The Cambridge English certification is also a positive. Given the right mentorship and learning opportunities, Alamanda has the potential to grow into a competent Front-End Developer. Score reflects a strong potential for growth, driven by a proactive approach to learning and a solid academic foundation. However, the candidate needs to focus on developing core front-end skills."

        "detailedAnalysis": "Alamanda's profile shows a good foundation for a Full-Stack Developer role, but lacks extensive professional experience. \n\n**Skills Match (18/30):** The candidate possesses fundamental technical skills like HTML, CSS, and SQL, which are essential for a full-stack role. The inclusion of Java is also a plus. However, there's no mention of JavaScript, a critical language for front-end development, or specific back-end frameworks (e.g., Node.js, Python/Django, Ruby on Rails). The presence of cybersecurity and machine learning skills, while valuable, are not directly relevant to core full-stack development. The soft skills listed are beneficial for communication and collaboration.\n\n**Experience Relevance (15/30):** Alamanda has internship experience as both a Front-End and Full-Stack Intern. The projects mentioned (Weather Forecast Application, Netflix Clone, Personal Portfolio Website, Task Manager Application) are relevant and demonstrate practical application of web development skills. However, the internship durations are relatively short (1-2 months each), suggesting limited depth of experience. The descriptions of responsibilities are somewhat generic and lack specific details on the technologies used and challenges overcome.\n\n**Education Alignment (15/20):** A B.Tech degree from Malla Reddy College of Engineering and Technology is a solid educational foundation. The high CGPA (9.33) indicates strong academic performance. While the degree itself doesn't guarantee full-stack expertise, it provides a good base for learning and applying the necessary skills.\n\n**Overall Potential (20/20):** Alamanda demonstrates high potential. The numerous certifications (Ethical Hacking, Web Development, Employability Skills) showcase a proactive approach to learning and skill development. The project descriptions, while brief, suggest an interest in applying technology to solve real-world problems. The candidate's willingness to pursue internships in both front-end and full-stack roles indicates a strong desire to learn and grow in this field. Given the right mentorship and opportunities, Alamanda has the potential to become a valuable full-stack developer."

Her technical skills list HTML and CSS, which are fundamental, but lacks mention of JavaScript or any modern front-end frameworks (React, Angular, Vue). The 'CodeKaro - HTML, CSS' certification is a positive indicator, but the absence of JavaScript knowledge is a significant gap. Her internship experience at DevElet developing a Netflix clone and a personal portfolio website is relevant and shows practical application of front-end technologies. The Full Stack internship is also a plus. The B.Tech degree is relevant, and the high CGPA is commendable. However, the projects listed lean more towards Deep Learning and voice assistance, which are less directly applicable to standard web development. The Internshala - Web Development certification is a positive signal. Her potential is moderate; she needs to demonstrate a stronger focus on core web development technologies, particularly JavaScript and associated frameworks, to significantly improve her fit. The Ethical Hacking certifications are not directly relevant but show a willingness to learn."

However, the depth of Java knowledge isn't clear. The inclusion of Cybersecurity Fundamentals and Machine Learning Algorithms, while valuable, are less directly relevant to a typical Junior Java Developer role.  The soft skills are beneficial. A slightly lower score reflects the need to verify the depth of her Java skills in an interview.\n\n**Experience Relevance (18/30):** The internships at DevElet provide some relevant experience.  Developing web applications (Netflix clone, task manager, portfolio) offers exposure to full-stack development concepts. The front-end internship is less directly related to Java development, but still valuable. The lack of specific Java-focused projects within the internship limits the score. The short duration of each internship also impacts the score slightly.\n\n**Education Alignment (18/20):** A B.Tech degree is a strong positive.  A CGPA of 9.33 is excellent and demonstrates academic aptitude. The education is highly relevant to the role.\n\n**Overall Potential (20/20):** Alamanda possesses several qualities indicating high potential.  The numerous certifications, including those in web development and ethical hacking, demonstrate a proactive approach to learning and skill development. The project descriptions, particularly the DeepFake detection project, showcase an interest in advanced technologies and problem-solving abilities. The voice-assisted calculator project demonstrates innovative thinking.  Her strong academic record and proactive learning attitude suggest a high capacity for growth and adaptation in a Junior Java Developer role. Her English proficiency (Cambridge certification) is also a plus."
