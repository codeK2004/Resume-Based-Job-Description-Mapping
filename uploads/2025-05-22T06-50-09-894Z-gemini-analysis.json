The internships, while short, provide some relevant experience, especially the front-end internship where they developed a Weather Forecast Application and Netflix Clone. The HTML/CSS skills are explicitly mentioned, and the CodeKaro certification further supports this. However, the resume lacks details on specific front-end frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) or advanced JavaScript knowledge. The overall potential is moderate, as the candidate demonstrates initiative through projects and certifications, but needs further development in core front-end technologies. The short duration of internships and lack of strong front-end framework skills limit the overall score."

Her internship experience at DevElet, particularly the Netflix clone and personal portfolio website projects, showcase practical application of front-end technologies like HTML and CSS. The Task Manager application suggests some full-stack exposure. The CodeKaro and Internshala certifications in HTML/CSS and web development further solidify her basic skills. However, the listed 'Technical Skills' section includes broader topics like Java, Cybersecurity, SQL, and Machine Learning, which while valuable, are not directly relevant to core web development. Her B.Tech degree provides a solid educational base. While her CGPA is excellent, the resume lacks specifics about the B.Tech major. The 'Overall Potential' score reflects her proactive engagement in internships and certifications, indicating a willingness to learn and grow. However, the short duration of the internships and the lack of in-depth project descriptions limit the assessment of her practical skills and problem-solving abilities. Further investigation into her specific contributions to the projects and her understanding of more advanced web development concepts (e.g., JavaScript frameworks, backend technologies) is recommended."
