The candidate's experience as a Front End and Full Stack Intern, developing applications like a Weather Forecast Application, Netflix Clone, Personal Portfolio Website, and Task Manager Application, demonstrates practical experience. However, the short duration of the internships (1-2 months each) and the limited number of core web development skills listed (beyond HTML/CSS) impact the overall score. The inclusion of skills like Java, Cybersecurity Fundamentals, SQL/Database Management, and Machine Learning Algorithms, while valuable, are not directly relevant to a Junior Web Developer role, suggesting a broader but less focused skillset. Overall potential is moderate, contingent on further development of core web development skills."
