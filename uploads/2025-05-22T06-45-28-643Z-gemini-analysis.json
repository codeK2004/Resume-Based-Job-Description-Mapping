        "detailedAnalysis": "Alamanda demonstrates a good foundation for a Junior Web Developer role. Her B.Tech degree with a high CGPA indicates strong academic aptitude. The internships at DevElet, focusing on both front-end and full-stack development, provide relevant practical experience, particularly with the development of applications like a Weather Forecast Application, Netflix Clone, Personal Portfolio Website, and Task Manager Application. The technical skills listed, including HTML, CSS, and Java, are essential for web development. While SQL/Database Management and Machine Learning Algorithms are valuable, they are less directly relevant for a junior *front-end* developer role. The CodeKaro and Internshala certifications in HTML and CSS, along with the Web Development certification, further solidify her skills. The projects, while interesting, seem more focused on areas outside of core web development (Deepfake detection, Voice-assisted calculator). Her soft skills, including proficiency in multiple languages, are a plus. Overall, Alamanda shows good potential, but her experience is limited to internships, and her project work isn't directly aligned with the typical responsibilities of a junior web developer. Further development in core front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) would significantly enhance her profile."

        "detailedAnalysis": "Alamanda's resume shows a good foundation for a Front-End Developer role, but lacks extensive professional experience. \n\n**Skills Match (22/30):** The candidate lists HTML and CSS, which are core front-end skills. The CodeKaro HTML/CSS certification is a positive indicator. However, the absence of JavaScript (a crucial front-end language) and modern front-end frameworks (React, Angular, Vue.js) significantly lowers the score. The inclusion of Java, SQL, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity Fundamentals, while valuable, are not directly relevant to a front-end role. \n\n**Experience Relevance (18/30):** The internship experience at DevElet is relevant. Developing a Netflix clone and a personal portfolio website are good projects. The Weather Forecast Application also aligns well. However, the internship durations are short (1-2 months each), indicating limited depth of experience. The 'Full Stack' internship also includes relevant experience, but the primary focus seems to be on the front-end aspects of those projects. \n\n**Education Alignment (15/20):** A B.Tech degree is generally acceptable for a front-end developer role. The high CGPA (9.33) is a positive indicator of academic aptitude. However, the resume doesn't specify the B.Tech major. A degree in Computer Science or a related field would have resulted in a higher score. \n\n**Overall Potential (13/20):** Alamanda demonstrates potential through project work and certifications. The DeepFake detection and voice-assisted calculator projects showcase problem-solving abilities and technical curiosity. The English proficiency certification (Cambridge C1) is a plus for communication. However, the lack of JavaScript and framework experience is a significant hurdle. The candidate needs to actively learn and demonstrate proficiency in these areas to maximize their potential in a front-end role."

While the internship durations are short, they provide practical experience. Her skills include HTML, CSS, and SQL, which are essential for full-stack development. The 'Java' skill is a plus. The ethical hacking certifications, while not directly related, showcase a proactive approach to learning and a broader understanding of security. The projects, especially 'SpeakSolve,' demonstrate problem-solving and application of technical skills. Areas for improvement include demonstrating experience with backend technologies and frameworks beyond SQL (e.g., Node.js, Python/Django, etc.). The short internship durations suggest a need for more in-depth, longer-term project experience. Overall, Alamanda possesses good potential and a strong foundation for growth in a full-stack development role. Further development of backend skills and more substantial project experience would significantly enhance her profile."
